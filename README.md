## About

I am a Fullstack Developer with professional experience since 2021, passionate about technology since childhood and driven by solving real-world problems through well-thought-out engineering.

Throughout my career, I have built solutions ranging from modern, high-performance user interfaces to backends designed for scale, cost efficiency, and concurrency, always seeking a balance between simplicity, performance, and long-term maintainability.

I strongly believe that engineering is about conscious decisions, not following trends. I enjoy studying system architecture, technical trade-offs, operational costs, and the organizational impact of technology choices. Currently, I am focusing my studies and projects on applied Artificial Intelligence, data-oriented system architectures, and the development of SaaS products.

My primary sources of learning are official documentation, technical books, and real-world production case studies.

## Engineering, AI & SaaS Focus

My current technical focus includes:

- Applied Artificial Intelligence  
- Machine Learning and intelligent automation  
- Data-oriented and scalable system architectures  
- SaaS product engineering  
- High-concurrency, cost-efficient APIs  
- Cloud cost optimization and long-term maintainability  
- Trade-offs between well-structured monoliths and microservices  

I believe AI only creates value when it solves real user problems, and that successful SaaS products are built on solid architectural decisions.
